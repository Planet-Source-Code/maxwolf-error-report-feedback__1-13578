### Description

This code will simply tell the user that an error has happened, and will let them mail the user or exit after the error has happened, I myself place this in my Form_Terminate section. This could be easily updated to work with a error trapper code of some kind, I take no credit for the e-mail program, it was created by someone else on PSC and many thanks to them. Also, on another note, please change the e-mail address to your own or something else, from mine, or that or send me feedback from the program :)

My first post, please vote if you like, hating me and closing your browser and stomping bunnies if you hate it...
 
### More Info
 
Creates a INI file with the program version and app path.
